***************************************************
Steps that I used to install the GSL on my Desktop*
***************************************************

1. First Download the GNU Scientific library from here (I used gsl-2.4)
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/

2. Unpack the contents by:
	tar -zxvf gsl-2.4.tar.gz

3. Go to the folder that contains the tar file (The packages folder in my case)
	cd gsl-2.4

4. Create a directory where you want to install this packages. (For additional info see the notes on which is the best folder for doing this--Folder_Installation.txt)

	sudo mkdir \usr\local\gsl -- this is where I installed it.
Then provide the password 

5. Now do 
	./configure --prefix=/home/yourname/dev

6.  Then  (add sudo if using the \usr\local directory)

	make

7. Then 

	make check

8. Then 

	make install


9. Now we can write a test program to see if the library works. Create the following program and name it example.cpp

	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <gsl/gsl_sf_bessel.h>

	int
	main (void)
	{
	double x = 5.0;
	double y = gsl_sf_bessel_J0 (x);
	printf ("J0(%g) = %.18e/n", x, y);
	return 0;
	}

10. Now Execute: (to learn more about this LD_LIBRARY_PATH see the file of the same name)

 	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/path/to/the/folder/created/in/step/4/gsl/lib

11. To compile use:


     g++ example.cpp -I /path/to/folder/above/include -L /path/to/folder/above/lib -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm

12. Run the executable that was created -- ./a.out
